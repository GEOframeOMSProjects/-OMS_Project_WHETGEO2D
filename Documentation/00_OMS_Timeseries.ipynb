    "[OMS](https://alm.engr.colostate.edu/cb/wiki/16976) can use data in [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) format for tabular input and output. There are some assumptions about the [structure](https://alm.engr.colostate.edu/cb/wiki/16970) of an OMS CSV file in order to use it for data reading/writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "A table is stored as an ASCII file using the CSV standard. The file has the extension .csv. The content is stored as comma separated values. Tables may have comment lines, which start with the pound symbol # in the first column. Empty lines are allowed anywere in a table and get ignored. Tables consists of columns and rows, and optional table meta data. Columns may have a type and optional meta data. Meta data is organized as pair key, value.\n",
    "A table requires two key words, `@table` and `@header`. The `@table` keyword tags the start of a table definition, the `@header` tag starts a column definition. Both tags are case insensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A CSV file consists of three main sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The table header, indicated by `@Table`, followed by the name of the table. The next lines may have table level meta data, one meta data entry per line. Meta data is optional.\n",
    "- The table header is followed by the column header, indicated by the `@Header` keyword. Next to this all the column names are listed. The next lines may contain column meta data, starting with the key, followed by the values for each column (Example above shows Type and Format for the columns).\n",
    "- Data rows start with a ',' as the first character; values are comma separated.\n",
